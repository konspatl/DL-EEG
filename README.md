# Introduction

A Deep Learning-based EEG (DL-EEG) decoding library for state-based tasks/analyses, using MNE and Tensorflow/Keras. 

This library is intended for EEG researchers and includes dataset processing tools, implementations of several cNN models, and scripts for model training, testing and visualization.

**The aim of this project is to provide:**

- a standard framework for EEG preprocessing and dataset extraction, suitable for machine learning analyses
- methods for creation and training of deep learning models that employ EEG-driven network designs and methodologies
- methods for evaluation and testing of deep learning models over a variety of EEG systems and learning tasks
- a consistent EEG-processing pipeline, by exploiting the spatio-temporal structure of the EEG 
- support for multi-study integration and cross-subject/cross-study validation schemes, aiming at improved research reproducibility
